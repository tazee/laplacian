# Laplacian Smoothing tools for Modo plug-in
This a Modo Plug-in kit to smooth mesh vertex positions using Laplacian algorithm based on a curvature flow Laplace Beltrami operator in a diffusion equation. This allows you to reduce noise on a meshâ€™s surface with minimal changes to its shape.

This kit contains a direct modeling tool and a procedural mesh operator for Modo macOS and Windows.

## Installing
- Download lpk from releases. Drag and drop into your Modo viewport. If you're upgrading, delete previous version.

## How to use Laplacian tool
The laplacian smoothing tool is named **xfrm.laplacian**. Type **tool.set xfrm.laplacian on** on command field of command history viewport. After setup the laplacian smoothing tool, you can see **Iterations** attribute on the tool property viewport.
This supports falloff weights.

## Building codes

- LXSDK
This kit requires Modo SDK (Modo 16.1v8 or later). Download and build LXSDK and set you LXSDK path to LXSDK_PATH in CMakeLists.txt in triagulate.
- Igl library.
This also requires Igl library. Download and build Igl from below and set the include path to CMakeLists.txt. libigl is header only library.
- Eigen
This also requires Eigen library. Download and install Eigen libray into your system.
